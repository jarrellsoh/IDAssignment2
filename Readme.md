My Assignment 2: Spotify Playlist Finder
This website uses the spotify API in order to allow users to choose a genre of their choice, then a playlist from that genre as well as the number of songs they want displayed. After pressing submit, they will get information about the songs in the playlist and can play the song directly from the website. 

Design Process
This project was made with the goal of allowing people to quickly look for playlists and listen to their songs without having to take up so much time doing so in the spotify app. 
I believe that I was successful in doing so as my website is simple and fulfills its purpose without much time wasted, and the design of the website, I believe, was also successful and aesthetic. 

User Stories: 
- As an avid music listener, I want to use this website to find out about more playlists and what the songs inside those playlists sounds like. 

In my assignment folder, you will see my wireframe made from AdobeXD. This wireframe gave me what the end product was supposed to look like and helped me immensely as it is alot easier to code with the end in mind. 

Existing Features
- Feature 1 - The layout of the page becomes different after a set width because of the media query that I used, which makes the website look good at any size. 
- Feature 2 - When the website goes into mobile view, the navigation bar turns into a pop-up bar that can be accessed by clicking on the "burger" icon at the top right hand corner. The sidebar is animated to pop out smoothly to enhance user experience. 
- Feature 3 - The navigation bar allows the user to go to whatever part of the page they like simply just by clicking on the respective name, making navigating through the site easy and user-friendly. 
- Feature 4 - The dropdown options for selecting the spotify genre and playlist are taken from the spotify API, and the names are accurate and will change as spotify adds more genres or playlist.
- Feature 5 - The website allows the user to choose the number of songs they want shown, which makes the website more customizable for users.
- Feature 6 - The website allows the user to go straight to the official Spotify website just by clicking either the Spotify.com at the navigation bar or the 'Open Spotify' button on the playlist portion of the page. 
- Feature 7 - The last part of the website which plays the songs will be hidden until the user presses 'view songs' which makes the website more simple and makes the website smoother.

Features Left to Implement
- Feature 1 - I would like to implement a feature that allows the user to add this playlist directly to their spotify just by clicking a button. 
- Feature 2 - I would like to implement a feature that allows the user to select multiple songs in this website and play them  immediately and directly from the website as a playlist
Technologies Used
This website uses html, css and javascript. 
- html determines the content and what goes into the website. 
- css makes up the design of the website and dictates what should go where. 
- javascript helps to implement complex and interactive features onto the website.

Contact form:
The form will prompt the user if an invalid input is found in the form. The no. of songs part only allows numbers to be keyed in to the website to prevent errors, and the max number of songs is 10, which means that if the number is more than 10, the website only displays 10 songs.
